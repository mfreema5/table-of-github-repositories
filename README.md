##README

The actual table of project repositories is the file &lsquo;[tablified-github-repositories.md](tablified-github-repositories.md)&rsquo;.

It's marked up using [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/).  (Shortcut to table formatting: [#Tables](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#tables).)

How to format links in GFH is covered at: [Markdown Basics/#Links](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#links).

To issue or review a pull request, click on the appropriate tab:  
<a href="Pull-request-tab-Ringer.jpg" title="Click for larger view."><img src="tPull-request-tab-Ringer.jpg" title="Map to pull-request tab" /></a>

To play around with pull requests, see: [the Spoon-Knife project](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife), &ldquo;a test repository thatâ€™s hosted on GitHub.com that lets you test the Pull Request workflow and the GitHub Desktop application&rdquo;. (Thanks for finding that, [Bing](https://github.com/xbim1810)!)
